  abstract={In todays world text search engine is used by the users for searching purpose. This is manual process and is prone to many human errors . There are some methods like applying filters and sort by options developed but these systems also have some or other drawbacks . In the current times it Is very difficult to get the exact results of your search input. To overcome the traditional systems we propose and intelligent Visual Search System. In this system a user can query by clicking an image of the product he/she wants and our deep search engine will search the internet for similar products and recommend the results. This is based on Deep Object detection model and a Deep Feature extraction pipeline designed to understand the image at the deepest level so as to differentiate different images and recommend the most similar products. The system is very user friendly and easy to use.},
