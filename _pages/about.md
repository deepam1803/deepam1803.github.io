I am a Data Scientist at [Crysagi Systems (acquired by Coreview Systems)](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ani/coreview-acquires-crysagi-systems-119081400734_1.html) working on problems in NLP, Computer Vision and Graph. I spend most of my time in applying deep learning research in NLP to solve business problems like extracting data from unstructured PDFs (Tables), Creating language models in Indian Languages(Hindi) to extracts named entities from unstructured hindi text, Developing graph based recommendation models.

Prior to Crysagi, I used to intern at [Storekey](https://storekey.in/english.html) where i spent most of my time developing  React Native apps and backend for mobile and web apps.
