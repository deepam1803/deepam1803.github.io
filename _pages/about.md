I am a Data Scientist at [Senquire Analytics](https://www.senquire.com) working on [Hedgepup](https://www.hedgepup.com/). Apart from this I spend most of my time applying cutting edge Deep Learning research in Computer Vision to solve business problems. 

Prior to Senquire I worked at [Crysagi Systems (acquired by Coreview Systems)](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ani/coreview-acquires-crysagi-systems-119081400734_1.html) working on a Recommendation System project for the Singapore Government's Health Promotion Board (HPB). Using Machine learning algorithms, created a system that 'nudges' the Singaporean population to eat healthy, take more steps, work out more, and attend fitness activities.I also worked on problems like extracting data from unstructured PDFs (Tables), Creating language models in Indian Languages(Hindi) to extracts named entities from hindi text, Developing graph based recommendation models.

Prior to Crysagi, I used to intern at [Storekey](https://storekey.in/english.html) where i spent most of my time developing  React Native apps and backend for mobile and web apps.
